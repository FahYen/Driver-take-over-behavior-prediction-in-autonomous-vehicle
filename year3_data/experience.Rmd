This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
experience.df = read_csv(".\\Demographic.csv") %>% select(id, age, years, annual_mile, daily, av_experience)
str(experience.df)
```

```{r}
library(GPArotation)
library(psych)
library(corrplot) 

# Assuming your data frame is named 'df'

# Step 2: Prepare the data
# Select only the experience-related columns for the factor analysis
exp_data <- experience.df %>% select(age, years, annual_mile, daily, av_experience)


# check assumptions
datamatrix <- cor(exp_data)
corrplot(datamatrix, method="number")

# Calculate the KMO measure
kmo_result <- KMO(exp_data)

# View the KMO result
print(kmo_result$KMO) # Overall KMO
print(kmo_result)     # Individual measures of sampling adequacy for each variable





# Step 3: Conduct the factor analysis
# Perform the factor analysis assuming one common factor, you can change the number of factors based on your assessment
fa_result <- fa(exp_data, nfactors = 1, rotate = "varimax")

# Check the summary to see if one factor is sufficient
print(fa_result)  # Adjust nfactors based on the eigenvalues and scree plot if necessary

# Step 4: Generate the factor scores
factor_scores <- fa_result$scores  # Extract the factor scores

# Step 5: Combine the factor scores with the participant IDs
# Assuming your participant ID column in df is named "participant_id"
final_data <- experience.df%>%
  select(id) %>%
  bind_cols(factor_scores)

# View the final data with factor scores
print(final_data)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
