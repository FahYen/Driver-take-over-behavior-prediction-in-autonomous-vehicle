This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
root_dir <- "D:\\Cloud Drives\\OneDrive - purdue.edu\\Second Ford\\Year 3\\ECG\\P02-B0.csv" 
test <- read_csv(root_dir)


folder_path <- "D:\\Cloud Drives\\OneDrive - purdue.edu\\Second Ford\\Year 3\\ECG\\"

# List all CSV files in the folder
csv_files <- list.files(path = folder_path, pattern = "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)

# Read the specified rows and columns from each CSV file and combine them into a single data frame

# add the filename, and combine them into a single data frame
data <- csv_files %>%
  purrr::map_df(function(file) {
    read_csv(file, col_names = FALSE, trim_ws= TRUE, skip_empty_rows=TRUE, skip = 58) %>% 
      slice(1:45) %>%
      select(1:2) %>%
      mutate(filename = basename(file))
  })
```

```{r}
# Extract characters and reshape
reshaped_df <- data %>%
  # Extract characters from filename
  mutate(id = substr(filename, 2, 3),
         task = substr(filename, 5, 6)) %>%
  # Reshape the data
  spread(key = X1, value = X2) %>% 
  select(-c(1,4,8,9,10,27,28,29,31,32,40,42)) %>% 
  mutate(task = as.factor(task)) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-task), as.numeric)

#convert data to 


str(reshaped_df)
```

```{r}
write_csv(reshaped_df, "hr.csv")
```





Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
